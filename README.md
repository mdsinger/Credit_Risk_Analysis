# Credit_Risk_Analysis

## Overview of Analysis

The purpose of this analysis was to apply machine learning to credit card risk. Using the credit card credit dataset from Lending Club, a peer-to-peer lending services company, the data was analyzed using oversampling techniques, undersampling techniques, and a combination of over and undersampling using imbalanced-learn, scikit-learn libraries, and SMOTE algorithims. An accuracy score, confusion matrix, and an imbalanced classification report were generated for each sampling technique.

## Results

The results of the analysis are as follows:

### Naive Random Oversampling: Accuracy Score: 0.64, Precision Score: 0.99, Recall Score: 0.62

### SMOTE oversampling: Accuracy Score: 0.63, Precision Score: 0.99, Recall Score: 0.64

### Undersampling: Accuracy Score: 0.53, Precision Score: 0.99, Recall Score: 0.45

### Combination of over and under sampling: Accuracy Score: 0.65, Precision Score: 0.99, Recall Score: 0.59

### Ensemble Learners: Accuracy Score: 0.93, Precision Score: 0.99, Recall Score: 0.94

### Balanced Random Forest Classifier: Accuracy Score: 0.79, Precision Score: 0.99, Recall Score: 0.91

## Summary

The results showed that Ensemble Learners model had the highest accuracy score so this is the recommended model to use.
